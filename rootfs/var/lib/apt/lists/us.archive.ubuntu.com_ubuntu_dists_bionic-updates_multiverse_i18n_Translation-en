Package: boinc-virtualbox
Description-md5: 690093958a0070907b98b36b21fb062c
Description-en: metapackage for virtualbox-savvy projects
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 Regular users (righteously) often find it an unbearable nuisance to
 care for the exact configuration of BOINC for virtualbox-based projects.
 This package adds a series of dependencies from the contrib
 section to the regular boinc package. This also meant this binary
 package to be redistributed in the contrib section of Debian.
